# Budgety PWA

A little app to help with those finances and budgeting. And its a PWA so it installs just like an app.
Its still a work in progress.

## Cool things
- Experimenting a bit with Repository + Controller pattern
- Using tanstack query
- Use controllers to generate react hooks to do CRUD operations on views
- Use collection models to generate forms (as in Transaction, Saving, Account, etc are models)

## Shortcuts to fix
- Took some shortcuts on typescript when generating collection hooks. They want arguments when they shouldnt get.
